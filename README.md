### Bug tracker
A bug tracker for all our products on Geometric Store and the store system itself

When you are submitting an issue, <b>make sure</b> you follow these steps:
1. Check if there already is an open issue with the same bug.
2. If there is an open issue, write a comment there with additional information that could help us solving the issue.
3. Otherwise, create a new ticket.
4. Provide us with device and version information as well as your tweak list if possible.
5. Provide detailed information on how to reproduce the bug. It is very important for us so we can be sure that we actually fixed it.
6. Wait for an update or any additional question from us.

We always try to fix the bugs people have, and we prioritize the ones that are most critical and affect a lot of people.
If we are unable to address an issue after a longer period, we rather issue a refund.
In that case, send an email to support@geometricsoftware.se
